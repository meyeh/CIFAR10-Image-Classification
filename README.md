# CIFAR-10 Image Classification
A digital image processing project that classifies images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories using deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop high-performing CNN models to classify CIFAR-10 images into 10 classes: **airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck**.  
The workflow includes data preprocessing, model design, training, evaluation, and performance analysis.

## Dataset
- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: A standard benchmark dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images.  
  - 50,000 images for training  
  - 10,000 images for testing 
- Each class contains 6,000 images.

## Notebook
- `CIFAR10_ImageClassification.ipynb`: Notebook containing,
    - Data loading and Preprocessing
    - Train, test, validation set creation
    - Creation of 3 CNN models
    - Image Augmentation
